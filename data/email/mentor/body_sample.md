Hello!

First, thank you so much for volunteering to be a Mentor! Our community is great because of people like you. If you are no longer able to complete a code review this week or attend our event on [EVENT_DAY] [EVENT_DATE] at [EVENT_START_TIME], please let me know ASAP. Life happens, but we like to be able to arrange for your Mentee to still have someone to pair with.

Your Mentee for [EVENT_DATE] is [MENTEE_NAME] ([MENTEE_EMAIL]). The code they submitted can be found here: [MENTEE_CODE]

**When asked what they wanted feedback on, they said**

> [MENTEE_FEEDBACK]

This month's event is at [SPONSOR_NAME]. [SPONSOR_NAME] is located at [SPONSOR_ADDRESS].

**How much time should I spend on the code review?**

Please complete your code review with feedback prior to the event [EVENT_DAY] evening. It shouldn't take you more than an hour. We are not looking for you to review and provide feedback on everything, but to provide enough feedback to facilitate the 1 hour pairing session on [EVENT_DAY] and give your Mentee some things to work through in the week after the event.

**Where should I put my feedback?**

If your Mentee provided a link to a pull request, great! Add your feedback as pull request comments. 

If they provided a link to their repository, then fork their repo, add inline comments to the code, and open a pull request. Here are a couple examples of what I mean

* https://github.com/cybernetck/FriendFinder/pull/12/files
* https://github.com/LtBackup/Bartender-Game/pull/53/files

**What makes good feedback?**

Don't forget to be aware of how you are delivering your feedback. All of our Mentees are here to learn and become better developers. Some tips:

* Use 'we' instead 'you,' i.e. "Can we make a class to encapsulate this logic?" 'We' sounds more collaborative and removes blame. Code is collaborative and the Mentees are really looking forward to pairing with you.
* Give suggestions for improvements instead of commands and provide context for why you are making the suggestion.
* Provide code examples, even if just pseudocode. All of the Mentees are here to learn, help them out by giving them a code example that you can talk through.
* Avoid words like 'obviously,' 'clearly,' and 'of course.' They are exclusionary to people who are still learning.
